title: "What I Want from a README"

When I come to a new codebase or repository on GitHub, I have a bunch of questions. A well-written README file can answer these.

* What is this code for? What does it do?
* How do I run the code on my machine? Bonus points for instructions that anyone can copy and paste, line-by-line, without having to think.
* Having set up the code on my machine, how do I verify that it's working?
* How do I run the tests? (You do *have* automated tests, don't you?)
* What are the query parameters, command line arguments, etc. etc. that I can pass to this app? If they're documented somewhere, where? If there's a file that enumerates them, can I have a link please?
* If I want to contribute to this app, how do I go about it?

Then there are other things I might want to know but don't necessarily expect to be in the README itself. It's helpful if there are some links to them though.

* Where do instances of this app exist in the wild? Are there URLs I can hit?
* Where are the instances of this app hosted?
* Where can I go to see monitoring of the live instances of the app?
