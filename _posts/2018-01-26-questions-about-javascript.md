* What do `apply`, `bind`, and `call` do?
* How is `this` determined?
* How does Class work?
* How do Promises work?
* How does async + await work?
* Explain closures.
* Why is immutability a good thing? Why is mutating Objects bad?
* Why are pure functions good?
* If you run `npm install` with different versions of npm, do you get different packages?
* How do errors work in Express? Especially, why are `console.log(error)` and `console.log(JSON.stringify(error, null, 2))` so different?!
