            <h3>Post-apocalyptic</h3>
            <p>Post-apocalyptic is a term used to describe fiction set after a cataclysmic event has ended human civili zation as we know it (usually accompanied by loss of human life on an almost unthinkable scale). The exact mechanism of the disaster is usually unimportant nuclear war, plague, asteroid strike, and so on. The importance of the theme is the human condition. If the world we know is torn away from us and humans suffer horrors beyond imagining in this transforma tion to a post-apocalyptic setting, how does human ity cope? Do we survive and thrive and overcome? Or do we lose our own humanity in the process, o ultimately fall to extinction? Those are the questions that drive this genre.</p>

            <h3>Conspiracy</h3>
            <p>To conspire means “to join in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or to use such means to accomplish a lawful end.” As such, a con spiracy theory attributes the ultimate cause of an event or a chain of events (whether political, societa or historical) to a secret group of individuals with immense power (including political, wealth and so on) who hide their activities from public view while manipulating events to achieve their goals, regard less of consequences. Many conspiracy theories contend that a host of the greatest events of history were initiated and ultimately controlled by such secret organizations. Of equal importance is the silent struggle between clandestine groups, waging a secret war behind the scenes to determine who influences the future.</p>

            <h3>Horror</h3>
            <p>Horror takes many forms, but in Eclipse Phase it is more psychological than gore. It is the uncertainty of survival, the suspense of finding malevolent things among the stars, the fear of the unknown, the dread of facing Things That Should Not Be, the revulsion when encountering alien things, and the sickening realization of the wrong and ghastly things that transhumans are capable of doing to themselves and each other. Horror also arises both from the comprehension that there are scary things beyond our understanding nhabiting our universe and that transhumanity may be its own worst enemy. Despite all of the technological tools and advances available to future transhumans, they still face terrors like losing control of their own dentities, their perceptions, and their mental faculties—not to mention their future as a species.</p>
